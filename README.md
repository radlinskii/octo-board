**OctoBoard** is  web app created to easily find github issues by labels, organization and language.

Depolyed at [octo-board.herokuapp.com](https://octo-board.herokuapp.com/).

### Build in development :wrench:

Need to cover more code with tests and use `go modules`.

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
